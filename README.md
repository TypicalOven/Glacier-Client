# Glacier Client

Open-sourcing this because I do not care anymore. I left Glacier and since it's my code, I'll do what I want.

I have removed any personal information of AustinFRG in the client and wish him well. Austin, I hope you stop associating with Glacier, as it has obviously taken a toll on your mental well-being.

Enclosed in this repo is the full source to Glacier Client and the Socket server. I might use this code in the future since it's honestly some of my best work (which is sad at some points)

You may not use this code unless your project is completely open-source, or you have permission from me. No license = no permission. Read more at https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/

If whoever the next Glacier developer is tries to use this, I'll be following through with a DMCA takedown.
## Message from my Discord server explaining what happened

I have ended my relations with Glacier after the owner intentionally shared data about me, breaking the privacy policy he put in place. Expect me to create a new, most likely open source client in the future to replace Glacier. 

I recommend you leave Glacier and cut all ties to them, as they are sharing people's info after agreeing not to. To view any of your information that may be shared, you can view their privacy policy, but I would recommend using a VPN as they will most likely attempt to leak your IP address.

If they continue to use the code I have created for them, I will be proceeding with a DMCA takedown request, if they continue I may even pursue legal action.

I do not want to cause any extra drama, I just wanted to make a statement about it. I will be releasing a document about my time with them as staff soon, including what led up to me deciding to leave, what they shared, and information about them that they may not necessarily want publicized (not personal information, information about some of their plans).
